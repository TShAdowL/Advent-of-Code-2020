        <p><strong>Day 3 Part A</strong></p>
        <p>With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport. While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe: there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees. You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.</p>
        <p>Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example:</p>
        <p class="codigo">
            ..##.......<br>
            #...#...#..<br>
            .#....#..#.<br>
            ..#.#...#.#<br>
            .#...##..#.<br>
            ..#.##.....<br>
            .#.#.#....#<br>
            .#........#<br>
            #.##...#...<br>
            #...##....#<br>
            .#..#...#.#
        </p>
        <p>These aren't the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times:</p>
        <p class="codigo">
            ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##....... ---><br>
            #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#.. <br>
            .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#. <br>
            ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.# <br>
            .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#. <br>
            ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##..... ---><br>
            .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....# <br>
            .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........# <br>
            #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#... <br>
            #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....# <br>
            .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.# ---><br>
        </p>
        <p>You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).</p>
        <p>The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:</p>
        <p>From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.</p>
        <p>The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:</p>
        <p class="codigo">
            ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##....... ---><br>
            #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#.. <br>
            .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#. <br>
            ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.# <br>
            .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#. <br>
            ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##..... ---><br>
            .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....# <br>
            .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........# <br>
            #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#... <br>
            #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....# <br>
            .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.# ---><br>
        </p>
        <p>In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.</p>
        <p>Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?</p>

        <p><strong>Day 3 Part B</strong></p>
        <p>Time to check the rest of the slopes - you need to minimize the probability of a sudden arboreal stop, after all.</p>
        <p>Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:</p>
        <p class="codigo">
            Right 1, down 1.<br>
            Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.) <br>
            Right 5, down 1. <br>
            Right 7, down 1. <br>
            Right 1, down 2. 
        </p>
        <p>In the above example, these slopes would find 2, 7, 3, 4, and 2 tree(s) respectively; multiplied together, these produce the answer 336.</p>
        <p>What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes?</p>
